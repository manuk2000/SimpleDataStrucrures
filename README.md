Data Structures README
This repository contains implementations of various fundamental data structures in computer science.

Double Linked List
A double linked list is a linear data structure where each element, known as a node, contains a link to the previous and next nodes, allowing traversal in both directions.

Hashtable
A hashtable is a data structure that maps keys to values, providing efficient lookup and insertion based on the key's hash.

Single Linked List
A single linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) holds data and a reference to the next node, allowing traversal in one direction.

Queue
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

Stack
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where elements are added and removed from the same end.

Vector
A vector is a dynamic array that grows or shrinks in size as needed, providing efficient random access and insertion at the end.
